# Items & Tags

OpenBin provides dedicated pages for browsing all items and tags across the active location. These give you a global view of your inventory without having to open individual bins.

## Items Page

The Items page lists every item across all bins in the active location.

- **Search** by item name to find which bin holds a specific thing.
- **Sort** by item name (alphabetical) or by bin name to group items by their container.
- **Paginated** results keep the page fast even for locations with thousands of items.

Clicking an item navigates directly to its parent bin's detail page.

::: tip
The Items page is the fastest way to answer "which bin has the Phillips screwdriver?" — just search for it and tap the result.

## Tags Page

The Tags page lists every tag used in the active location.

- **Search** by tag name to find a specific tag.
- **Sort** by tag name (alphabetical) or by usage count to see which tags are most common.
- Each tag shows how many bins use it.

Clicking a tag opens the bin list filtered to only bins with that tag applied.

## Tag Colors

Tags can be assigned a custom color that appears consistently throughout the app — on bin cards, in the filter panel, and on tag badges.

Tag colors are set **per location**, so different locations can use different color schemes for the same tag name.

### Setting a Tag Color

1. Open the **Tags** page.
2. Tap the color indicator next to a tag.
3. Choose a color from the picker.
4. The color is applied immediately and visible to all location members.

To remove a custom color, clear the color assignment from the same picker. Tags without a custom color use the default appearance.

## Access

The Items and Tags pages are accessible from the sidebar navigation on desktop or the bottom navigation bar on mobile.
