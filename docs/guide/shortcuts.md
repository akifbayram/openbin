# Keyboard Shortcuts

OpenBin supports keyboard shortcuts for fast navigation and common actions. Shortcuts are available on desktop and are disabled while typing in input fields or text areas to avoid conflicts.

## Command Palette

Press **Cmd+K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows/Linux) to open the command palette. Type to search and jump to any bin, area, or page. Results filter as you type — press Enter to navigate to the selected result.

The command palette is the fastest way to get anywhere in the app without touching the mouse.

## Navigation Shortcuts

Navigation shortcuts use a two-key sequence: press **G** followed by a second key to go to a page.

| Shortcut | Destination |
|---|---|
| `G` then `H` | Dashboard (Home) |
| `G` then `B` | Bins list |
| `G` then `S` | Search |
| `G` then `P` | Print Labels |
| `G` then `L` | Locations |
| `G` then `I` | Items |
| `G` then `T` | Tags |
| `G` then `E` | Settings |

Press the keys in sequence — press and release **G**, then press the second key.

## Action Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `N` | Create new bin |
| `/` | Focus the search input |
| `?` | Show keyboard shortcuts help |
| `[` | Toggle sidebar (desktop only) |

## Viewing the Shortcut Reference

Press **?** from any non-input context to open the full keyboard shortcuts help overlay. This is useful as a quick reference until you have the shortcuts memorized.
