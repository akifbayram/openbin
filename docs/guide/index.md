# User Guide

This guide covers every feature in OpenBin. If you haven't set up OpenBin yet, start with the [Getting Started](/getting-started/) guide.

## How OpenBin Works

OpenBin organizes physical storage using a simple hierarchy:

**Location** → **Area** → **Bin** → **Items**

- A **Location** is a shared workspace (e.g. "Home", "Workshop"). All data lives inside a location.
- An **Area** is an optional sub-zone within a location (e.g. "Garage", "Closet") for grouping bins.
- A **Bin** represents a physical container — a box, drawer, or shelf. Each bin gets a unique QR code.
- **Items** are the individual things stored inside a bin.

### Typical Workflow

1. [Register and create or join a location](/guide/locations)
2. [Create bins](/guide/bins) for your physical containers
3. [Print QR labels](/guide/print-labels) and attach them to your bins
4. [Scan a label](/guide/qr-scanning) to instantly see what's inside
