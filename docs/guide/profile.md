# Account & Profile

Your profile settings control how you appear to other location members and how you access your account. Open profile settings from the user menu in the top navigation bar.

## Avatar

Upload a profile picture to personalize your account.

- **Supported formats**: JPEG, PNG, or WebP
- **Maximum size**: 2 MB
- **Remove**: delete your avatar to revert to the default placeholder

Your avatar appears next to your name in activity logs, member lists, and the navigation bar.

## Display Name

Your display name is what other location members see. Change it at any time — the update is reflected everywhere immediately.

## Email

Optionally add or update your email address. Email is not required for account functionality but may be used for future features like notifications or account recovery.

## Password

Change your password from the profile page.

1. Enter your **current password** for verification.
2. Enter and confirm a **new password**.

Password requirements:

- At least 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one digit

## Account Info

The profile page shows your **username** and **account creation date**. Your username is set at registration and cannot be changed.

## Delete Account

Permanently delete your account and all associated data.

1. Tap **Delete Account** at the bottom of the profile page.
2. Enter your password to confirm.
3. Confirm the deletion.

::: danger
Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.

What happens when you delete your account:

- **Locations where you are the sole admin** are deleted along with all their bins, photos, and member data.
- **Shared locations** (where other admins exist) are preserved — only your membership is removed.
- Your profile, avatar, and personal settings are permanently erased.
