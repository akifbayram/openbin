# Dashboard

The Dashboard is the home screen after login. It provides an at-a-glance overview of your location's inventory and quick access to frequently-used bins and views.

## Stats Bar

The top of the dashboard shows three summary counts for the active location:

- **Total bins** — all non-deleted bins in the location
- **Total areas** — number of defined areas
- **Total items** — sum of all items across every bin

## Pinned Bins

Bins you've pinned appear at the top of the dashboard for instant access. Pinning is personal — your pinned bins are not visible to other members.

**To pin a bin**: open the bin's detail page → tap the **Pin** button in the toolbar (or the action menu on mobile).

**To unpin**: tap the Pin button again, or use the unpin action from the dashboard.

Pinned bins can be reordered by dragging them on the dashboard.

## Recently Scanned

Shows bins you scanned recently via the QR scanner or manual short code lookup. The list is personal — it reflects your own scan history, not the location's.

The number of entries shown is configurable in dashboard settings. Clear your scan history from **Settings → Clear Scan History**.

## Recently Updated

Shows bins in the location that were most recently edited, sorted by `updated_at` descending. This is location-wide — it includes changes made by any member.

Useful for staying informed about what's changed in a shared location.

## Needs Organizing

Shows bins that have **all three** of the following gaps:

- No items
- No tags
- No area assigned

These are bins that were created but not fully set up. The count gives you a cleanup target. Click the section to see the list.

## Area Breakdown

A summary of how many bins are in each area, sorted by bin count descending. Unassigned bins appear at the bottom if any exist.

## Saved Views

Saved filter/sort presets (created from the bin list — see [Search & Filter](/guide/search-filter#saved-views)) appear on the dashboard as quick-access buttons. Clicking one opens the bin list with those filters pre-applied.

This is useful for frequently-used queries like "Show all bins in the Garage with the Electronics tag".
